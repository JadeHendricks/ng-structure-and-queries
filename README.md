# Angular Structure & Queries Playground

This project explores **Angularâ€™s structural directives, template rendering techniques, view queries**, and the **new signal-based APIs**.  
Each concept is demonstrated on its own dedicated page with clear, minimal examples for easy learning.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

### 1) Structural & Template Features
- `ng-content` â€“ Content projection into components.
- `ng-container` â€“ Logical grouping without extra DOM.
- `ng-template` â€“ Reusable template blocks.
- `ngTemplateOutlet` â€“ Rendering templates dynamically.

### 2) Classic View Queries
- `ViewChild` â€“ Query a single element/directive from the template.
- `ViewChildren` â€“ Query multiple elements/directives from the template.

### 3) **Signal-Based Queries** (function APIs)
> These return **signals** and stay up-to-date without lifecycle hooks.
- `viewChild()` â€“ Signal of a single view child.
- `viewChildren()` â€“ Signal of multiple view children.
- `contentChild()` â€“ Signal of a single projected (content) child.
- `contentChildren()` â€“ Signal of multiple projected (content) children.
